## Executive Summary
  
This project proposes design of **an analytics dashboard to** interactively and dynamically **display swap gas fees** (swap fees) on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org). The dashboard also displays other charts that give analytical insights into the Uniswap ecosystem. 

The proposed SwapGasFees app is not implemented during the period of [UniCode Competition 2021](https://unicode.ethglobal.com/), due to lack of time and difficulties in finding team members. Yet, it outlines a blue print of how such a system can be implemented over an extended time period. In other words, the design provides a template, through which such a dashboard can be coded.

## Uniswap and Swap Fees

[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org) is the by far most popular decentralized exchange in the world, enabling swaps (exchanges) of many different tokens and coins on the Ethereum layer 1 blockchain network.

One of the fundamental issues in swaps is the "swap gas fee", which is in a way the fee paid to the blockchain network for evaluating and recording a swap transaction. The swap gas fees, or in short, swap fees, can change significantly over time, depending on the congestion of the Ethereum network, level of liquidity, trade volume, and many other factors. Swap fees strongly depend on the gas fees of the Ethereum blockchain, which are explained in this [Hackernoon tutorial article](https://hackernoon.com/ethereum-gas-fees-for-dummies-oj8135nn), this [BeInCrypto tutorial article](https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-gas-fees-lowest/) and this [Amberdata tutorial article](https://amberdata.io/docs/guides/ethereum-gas-price-and-predictions/).

Since the swap gas fees vary over time continuously, and sometimes significantly, it is important to have an analytics tool that can provide insights on how the gas fees are changing over time. 

While there exist some websites/apps that report/visualize the Ethereum gas fees, to the author's best knowledge, there does _not_ exist a website/app that shows swap gas fees for the Unicode ecosystem. This project involves the design and communication of such an analytics app, as a first Dapp of its kind.

## Design Principles

When designing the user interface, the [Gestalt Principles](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/gestalt-principles) of School of [M. Wertheimer (Wertheimer, 2020)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-36063-4) and the knowledge visualization guidelines of [Eppler and Burkhard (2008)](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/knowledge-visualization/25136) were applied. 

For selecting the visualizations most suitable for each analysis, the [D3 Visualization Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery) available under [ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/) were scanned and the following guideline documents were used as reference:
- [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)
- [The Data Visualization Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/search.html)
- [Visual Vocabulary](https://public.tableau.com/views/VisualVocabulary/VisualVocabulary?:showVizHome=no)
- [Power BI Visuals Reference](https://www.sqlbi.com/ref/power-bi-visuals-reference/) 
 
## Data Extraction

The following resources/libraries can be used for data extraction from Uniswap:

- The most **important** resource is the [Uniswap v3 contract maps](https://j1mmy.fi), which document the Pool Contract, Factory Contract, and Position Manager.
- [BitQuery](https://graphql.bitquery.io/ide) (to query data from blockchains)
- [Flipside Crypto](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com) (to query data from blockchains)
- [GraphQL](https://medium.com/coinmonks/get-uniswap-data-using-the-graph-79d0c6f7b9f2) (to extract data from Uniswap)

## UI Design 

This section describes the basic design of the user interface (UI) for the proposed SwapGasFees app. 
- A separate detailed [tutorial](Tutorial.md) describes the working of the designed app, explaining step by step, the different screens of the app. 
- The full UI design can be downloaded as a pdf file from [here](./figures/SwapGasFees_Design.pdf).

There are two main screens/interfaces in the app:

- **Interface 1:** Analytics for gas fees for a selected swap pair  (under the `Swap`, `Pools`, and `Favorites` tabs) 
- **Interface 2:** Analytics for gas fees and Uniswap pools, in general (under the `Charts` tab)

Now let us look into both of these interfaces, and explain each.


## Interface 1: Swap Gas Fees
1. After the `Show Swap Fees` button is clicked, the app extracts data from a database populated apriori, and displays two visualizations. 
2. The first visualization, on the upper right, is the swap gas fee for the selected fee, `by Hour` of the day. 
3. In the `by Hour` visualization, there are four rows, corresponding to the swap fees for `today`, `yesterday`, `this week`, and `this month`.
4. The black rectangle with the thick border shows the current time of the day.
5. The legend on the right hand side displays the fees with respect to the color scale.
6. The important text are shown in bold, including the text for `today`, current time, and fees for the current time and benchmark time points. 
7. The second visualization is on the lower right hand side, displaying swap gas fees `by Day`. 
8. The `by Day` visualization again displays the gas fees, but based on day of the year and month, enabling benchmark with previous months of the same year and the similar days of the past year.
9. In both visualizations, the unrealized future time periods are shown as blank (white color).
10. Using the two visualizations, a user can visually grasp whether now is a good time to swap or not.
11. Sample source code for implementing the first visualization can be found as ["World History Timeline"](https://observablehq.com/@tezzutezzu/world-history-timeline). Sample source code for the second calendar visualization can be found as ["Calendar"](https://observablehq.com/@d3/calendar), both under the [ObservableHQ Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery). The JavaScript visualization library used is [D3.js](https://d3js.org).

## Interface 2: Uniswap Analytics
1. The second main function of the SwapGasFees app is the display of various charts, under the `Charts` tab, to enable a deeper understanding of the Uniswap ecosystem.
2. The `Charts` tab implements a different interface than the earlier three tabs: There is a display (possibly with a legend) and two navigation buttons, namely `Previous Chart` and `Next Chart`. This interface design again is targeted to minimize the cognitive load on the user, allowing the user to digest the reported results one at a time.
3. The first screen has the `Previous Chart` button disabled, yet still in display, to provide a hint of what is to come.
4. The first screen of the `Charts` tab immediately provides the most important information, off the bat: _"What are the best times for swaps of top pairs?"_
5. The visualization shows time on the x axis and top pairs on the y axis (as rows). 
6. Each bar displays the favorable times for each swap pair. There has to be a consistent rule for all pairs, to identify the best times, such as _"Select the times where the price is at the lower 30% quartile"_.
7. While the presented visualization shows bars as a single color, each bar can potentially be drawn to allow a color spectrum.
8. Sample source code for implementing this visualization can be found as ["World timeline visualization"](https://observablehq.com/@tezzutezzu/world-history-timeline), under [ObservableHQ Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery). The JavaScript visualization library used is [D3.js](https://d3js.org).

## Visualizations

The main library to be used for visualizations is selected as [D3.js](https://d3js.org):
- [D3 Visualization Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery) (JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data)

The following are sample code for the visualizations presented throughout the SwapGasFees app:

<ul>
  <li>Visualizations for the <b>first three tabs</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/the-impact-of-vaccines" target="_blank">Timeline</a> (for Screens 2-6)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/calendar" target="_blank">Calendar</a> (for Screens 2-6)</li>
      </ul> 
  <li>Visualizations for the <b>Charts tab</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@tezzutezzu/world-history-timeline" target="_blank">Timeline</a> (for Screen 7) (to see which are the cheapest hours or the day/week for each swap pair, where pairs are the rows, color is the gas fee)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/bubble-chart" target="_blank">Bubble chart</a> (for Screen 8) (showing volumes of all pairs, or coins in pools, size is volume, color can be volume/liquidity, red color tones if above median)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/streamgraph" target="_blank">Stacked Area Chart</a> (for Screen 9) (to see changes in volume and liquidity, color is pair)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/the-wealth-health-of-nations" target="_blank">Animated scatter plot</a> (for Screen 10) (to see changes in multiple dimensions, as an animation)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/chord-diagram" target="_blank">Chord diagram</a> (for Screen 11) (to see volume & liquidity changes in pools, and in coins)</li>
      </ul> 
  <li><b>Other</b> possible visualizations under <b>Charts</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/realtime-horizon-chart" target="_blank">Realtime Horizon Chart</a> (scrolling data, where time is x axis, pair is y axis, and color is the gas fee)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/treemap" target="_blank">Treemap</a> (showing volumes of all pairs)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/sankey" target="_blank">Sankey Diagram</a> (changes in volume of pairs, color shows pair)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/arc-diagram" target="_blank">Arc diagram</a> (to see the pairs in the pools, color shows the main coin, such as ETH, USDT, USDC, DAI)</li>
  </ul> 
</ul> 

## Suggested Technology Stack

- For the **backend**, the above data extraction tools can be tested, and the one that provides the fastest and most reliable results can be selected.
- For the **frontend**, the easiest thing to do would be to fork the Uniswap front-end code and do modifications on that. 
- For **visualizations**, as mentioned earlier, the most suitable library is thought to be [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). The [D3 Visualization Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery) at [Observable HQ](https://observablehq.com/@d3/) provides sample source codes for all the essential charts, that can be used in the SwapGasFees app.

## Related Work

As mentioned earlier, there exist websites/apps that report/visualize the Ethereum gas fees. Some notable ones are the following:
- [Crypto.com DeFi Dashboard - Gas Fees:](https://crypto.com/defi/dashboard/gas-fees) This online service is most related to our proposed app, as it displays not only the Ethereum gas fees but also the gas fees for different swap pairs.
- [EthereumPrice.org:](https://ethereumprice.org/gas/) This website displays gas price over time, and time of the day. Especially the visualization of fees through heat map is impressive. While the information provided in SwapGasFees app overlaps with the information provided at EthereumPrice.org, the interface is designed to yield much more insights, through benchmarking. Furthermore, the mentioned website displays only Ethereum gas price and not the swap fees, whereas the SwapGasFees app designed in this project displays the latter.
- [Matteo Leibowitz's Dune Analytics Dashboards:](https://dune.xyz/MatteoLeibowitz/uniswap-community) This rich collection of dashboards display several statistics for the Uniswap ecosystem. In comparison to this collection, the goal of the SwapGasFees project was to develop a single intuitive dashboard app that presents only the most essential few visualizations.
