## Abstract
  
This tutorial descibes the working of the proposed SwapGasFees app, **an analytics dashboard to** interactively and dynamically **display swap gas fees** (swap fees) on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org). The dashboard also displays other charts that give analytical insights into the Uniswap ecosystem. 

The proposed SwapGasFees app is not implemented during the period of [UniCode Competition 2021](https://unicode.ethglobal.com/), due to lack of time and difficulties in finding team members. Yet, it outlines a blue print of how such a system can be implemented over an extended time period. In other words, the design provides a template, through which such a dashboard can be coded.

## **Slide 1:** Opening Screen, `Swap Fee`Tab, and Options


## **Slide 2:** Selecting a Swap Pair and the Amount


## **Slide 3:** Visualizing Swap Fees for the Selected Pair


## **Slide 4:** Selecting a Swap Pair from Top `Pools` from Under `Pools` Tab


## **Slide 5:** Selecting a Swap Pair with Default Amount of 1 ETH


## **Slide 6:** Visualizing Swap Fees for the Selected Top Pair


## **Slide 7:** Timeline Visualization under `Chart` Tab


## **Slide 8:** Bubble Chart Visualization under `Chart` Tab


## **Slide 9:** Arc Diagram Visualization under `Chart` Tab


## **Slide 10:** Animated Scatter Plot under `Chart` Tab


## **Slide 11:** Chord Diagram under `Chart` Tab

## Visualizations

The main library to be used for visualizations is selected as [D3.js](https://d3js.org):
- D3 Visualization Gallery (JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data)
https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery

<ul>
  <li>Visualizations for the <b>first three tabs</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/the-impact-of-vaccines" target="_blank">Timeline</a> (for slides 2-6)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/calendars" target="_blank">Calendar</a> (for slides 2-6)</li>
      </ul> 
  <li>Visualizations for the <b>Charts tab</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@tezzutezzu/world-history-timeline" target="_blank">Timeline</a> (for slide 7) (to see which are the cheapest hours or the day/week for each swap pair, where pairs are the rows, color is the gas fee)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/bubble-chart" target="_blank">Bubble chart</a> (for slide 8) (showing volumes of all pairs, or coins in pools, size is volume, color can be volume/liquidity, red color tones if above median)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/arc-diagram" target="_blank">Arc diagram</a> (for slide 9) (to see the pairs in the pools, color shows the main coin, such as ETH, USDT, USDC, DAI)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/the-wealth-health-of-nations" target="_blank">Animated scatter plot</a> (for slide 10) (to see changes in multiple dimensions, as an animation)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/chord-diagram" target="_blank">Chord diagram</a> (for slide 11) (to see volume & liquidity changes in pools, and in coins)</li>
      </ul> 
  <li><b>Other</b> possible visualizations under <b>Charts</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/realtime-horizon-chart" target="_blank">Realtime Horizon Chart</a> (scrolling data, where time is x axis, pair is y axis, and color is the gas fee)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/treemap" target="_blank">Treemap</a> (showing volumes of all pairs)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/streamgraph" target="_blank">Stacked Area Chart</a> (to see changes in volume and liquidity, color is pair)</li>
        <li><a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/sankey" target="_blank">Sankey Diagram</a> (changes in volume of pairs, color shows pair)</li>
  </ul> 
</ul> 


## Suggested Technology Stack

- For the **backend**, the above data extraction tools can be tested, and the one that provides the fastest and most reliable results can be selected.
- For the **frontend**, the easiest thing to do would be to fork the Uniswap front-end code and do modifications on that. 
- For **visualizations**, as mentioned earlier, the most suitable library is thought to be [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). The [D3 Visualization Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery) at [Observable HQ](https://observablehq.com/@d3/) provides source codes for all the essential charts, that can be used in the SwapGasFees app.
