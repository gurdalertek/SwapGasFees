## Abstract
  
This tutorial descibes the working of the proposed SwapGasFees app, **an analytics dashboard to** interactively and dynamically **display swap gas fees** (swap fees) on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org). The dashboard also displays other charts that give analytical insights into the Uniswap ecosystem. 

The proposed SwapGasFees app is not implemented during the period of [UniCode Competition 2021](https://unicode.ethglobal.com/), due to lack of time and difficulties in finding team members. Yet, it outlines a blue print of how such a system can be implemented over an extended time period. In other words, the design provides a template, through which such a dashboard can be coded.

The following sections describe the working of the proposed app, through different screens.  

## **Slide 1:** Opening Screen, `Swap Fee`Tab, and Options
