## Abstract
  
This tutorial descibes the working of the proposed SwapGasFees app, **an analytics dashboard to** interactively and dynamically **display swap gas fees** (swap fees) on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org). The dashboard also displays other charts that give analytical insights into the Uniswap ecosystem. 

The proposed SwapGasFees app is not implemented during the period of [UniCode Competition 2021](https://unicode.ethglobal.com/), due to lack of time and difficulties in finding team members. Yet, it outlines a blue print of how such a system can be implemented over an extended time period. In other words, the design provides a template, through which such a dashboard can be coded.

The following sections describe the working of the proposed app, through different screens.  

## **Slide 1:** Opening Screen, `Swap Fee` Tab, and Options

1. The first opening screen of the app is the `Swap Fee` Tab, with the tabs, swap pair selection on the left, and `Options` button at the left bottom. 
2. The simple design orients the user to the interface, avoiding any chance of overwhelming. 
The interface, as can easily be noticed by those familiar with [Uniswap](https://uniswap.com), directly mimics the Uniswap interface. This enables a mental resonance in the user's cognition, that this app is indeed related to Uniswap. 
While being similar to Uniswap interface, the SwapGasFees interface is even simpler, and does not require connecting to a wallet.
There are four tabs, namely, `Swap Fees`, `Pools`, `Favorites`, and `Charts`. 
Swap pair is selected on the left hand side from the drop-down menus, just as in Uniswap.
It is possible to add a pair as a favorite, through clicking the gray heart and turning it into red.
All favorite pairs are made available under the `Favorite` tab.
Until the swap amount is selected, the swap button is not activated.
The `Options` in the lower left corner can be seen through clicking the triangle. It will disappear when the triangle is pressed again.
`Options` are first day of the week, email address as input, and the selected color scheme.
