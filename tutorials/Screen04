## Screen 4: Selecting a Swap Pair from Top `Pools` from Under `Pools` Tab
1. The next available tab is the `Pools` tab. 
2. When the `Pools` tab is clicked, the top pools in Uniswap are displayed on the left hand side of the screen. 
3. As in the opening screen, this screen also begins very simple, making sure not to crowd the screen, unless a specific selection is made.
4. Top liquidity pools, in the same order as `Top pools` under Uniswap's `Pools`tab, and their pairs are displayed together with the total value locked (TVL).
5. From the list of pools, favorite pools can be added to the list of `Favorites` by clicking the gray heart next to it and turning it into red. The reverse action removes that pair from the list of `Favorites`.
6. It is worth noting that there is no action button active at the moment. Instead, there is a message that prompts `Please select a pair (for 1 ETH worth of swap)`. This makes it clear that the swap fees to be displayed will be for a swap with 1 ETH worth. In other words, there is no specification of amount here, to make the interface cognitively manageable.
