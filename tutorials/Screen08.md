## Screen 8: Bubble Chart  
1. The next visualization under the `Charts` tab is the bubble chart, which displays the total value locked (TVL) in top pools and the ratio of weekly volume to TVL.
2. Each circle represents a pool in the top pools list and the size of each circle denotes the total value locked (TVL) in that pool.
3. Color of each circle shows the ratio (Weekly Volume)/TVL. This is a measure of _"turnover"_ of the pool. Higher values (darker colors) suggest that the pool is actively used, whereas light colors suggest that the pool is not actively used.
4. The legend on the right had side maps the color scale to the actual swap values of the mentioned ratio.
5. Sample source code for implementing this visualization can be found as ["Circle Packing - Bubble chart"](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bubble-chart), under [ObservableHQ Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery). The JavaScript visualization library used is [D3.js](https://d3js.org).
