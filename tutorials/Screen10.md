## Screen 10: Animated Scatter Plot
1. The next visualization is an animated scatter plot, where the changes in time are reflected in the time flow of the animation.
2. The animated scatter plot was developed and popularized by the legendary information visualization pioneer, [Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling), especially through his [TED Talks](https://www.gapminder.org/videos/). 
3. Implemented firstly in the [Trendalyzer software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trendalyzer) by the GapMinder Foundation, animated scatter plot has become a popular tool for displaying changes of discrete entities over time, with respect to four or more dimensions (plus time).
4. The four dimensions of an attribute are reflected on the x axis, y axis, size of the circles (glyphs), and the color of the circles. Time is the fifth dimension.
5. In the design developed specifically for Uniswap, each swap pair is an entity, represented as a circle. 
6. x axis denotes the TVL and the y axis denotes volume. 
7. The (Volume/TVL) ratio, which is a measure of the _"turnover"_ of the pair on Uniswap, is chosen to be denoted by the size of the circle. Low values of this ratio can identify pairs that have too much liquidity compared to volume.
8. Finally, color is used to denote the particular swap pair. (The visualization presented below is only representative, but not exactly reflective).
9. When the scatter plot is animated over time, the circles move, expand and contract, shift regions as groups on the two-dimensional plane, and do many other fascinating things.
10. Sample source code for implementing this visualization can be found as ["The Wealth & Health of Nations"](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/the-wealth-health-of-nations).
