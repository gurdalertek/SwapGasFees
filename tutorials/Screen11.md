## Screen 11: Chord Diagram 
1. The last visualization under the `Charts` tabs, designed to be available, is the chord diagram. 
2. This diagram displays the changes of liquidity across assets. Specifically, it displays what portion of liquidity of an asset has moved to another asset in a given time period, such as a week.
3. Chord diagram is a suitable visualization technique to identify _"churn"_, which is the switching across different entities (across different assets, in this case).
4. Sample source code for implementing this visualization can be found as ["Chord Diagram"](https://observablehq.com/@d3/chord-diagram).
